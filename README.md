# What's this game?

* Facilities Management is a stealth game from the perspective of the usual opponent in a stealth game
* Instead of controlling an infiltrator, you've been employed to foil them.  (Not mano y mano - that'd be a tough job!)
* You'll build a facility to company spec, then add the security features you think it needs given your budget
* Test your defenses against multiple difficulty classes of infiltrator, with bonuses for good performance
* Be noticed!  Contract your skills to the highest bidder!  Become wealthier!  Be the subject of raised expectations!

    ## OK, any tips for playing?
    * Right now, you really can't 'play' - it's too early in development.
